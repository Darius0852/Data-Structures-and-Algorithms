# Linear Search Algorithm

Linear search is a very basic and simple algorithm. In Linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.

Time complexity of Linear search algorithms is **O(n)**.

## Implementing Linear Search

Following are the steps of implementation that we will be following:

1. Traverse the array using a for loop.
2. In every iteration, compare the target value with the current value of the array.
  - If the values match, return the current index of the array.
  - If the values do not match, move on to the next array element.
3. If no match is found, return -1.

To search the number 5 in the array given below, linear search will go step by step in a sequential order starting from the firsy element in the given array.
