# Space Complexity of Algorithms

Whenever a solution to a problem is written sime memory is required to complete. For any algorithm, memory may be used for the following:

1. Variables (This include the constant values, temporary values)
2. Program Instruction
3. Execution

**Space complexity** is the amount of memory used by the algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result.

Sometimes **Auxiliary Space** is confused with Space Complexity. But Auxiliary Space is the extra space or the temporary space used by the algorithm during it's execution.

**Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space**

## Memory Usage While Execution

While executin, an algorithm uses memory space for three reasons:

1. **Instruction Sapce**
  It's the amount of memory used to save the compiled version of instructions.
  
2. **Envrionmental Stack**
  Sometimes an algorithm(function) may be called inside another algorithm(function). In such a situation, the current variables are pushed onto the system stack, where they wait for further execution and then the call to the inside algorithm(function) is made. 
  
For example, if a function A() calls function B() inside it, then all the variables of the function A() will get stored on the system stack temporarily, while the function B() is called and executed inside funtion A().

3. **Data Space**
  Amount of space used by the variables and constants. 
  
  
But while calculating the **Space Complexity** of any algorithm, we usually consider only the **Data Space** and we neglect the **Instruction Space** and **Environmental Stack**.


## Calculating the Space Complexity

For calculating the space complexity, we need to know the value of memory used by different types of datatype variables, which generally varies for different operating systems, but the method for calculating the space complexity remaind the same.
