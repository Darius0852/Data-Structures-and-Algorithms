# Time Complexity of Algorithms

For any defined problem. there can be N number of solutions. This is true in general. 
If I have a problem and I discuss about the problem with all of my freinds, they will 
all suggest me different solutions. And I am the one who has to decide which solution 
is the best based on the circumstances.

Similaroty for any problem which must be solved using a program, there can be infinite
number of solutions. Let's take a simple example to understand this. Below we have two different 
algorithms to find the square of a number (for some time, forget that square of any number n is n x n):

One solution to this problem can be, running a loop for n times, starting with the number n and adding n to it,
every time. 

```
/* 
    we have to calculate the square of n
*/
for i=1 to n
    do n = n + n
// when the loop ends n will hold its square
return n
```

Or, we can simply use a mathematical operator * to find the square.
```
/* 
    we have to calculate the square of n
*/
return n*n
```
In the above two algorithms, you saw how a single problem can have many solutions.
While the first solution required a loop which will execute for n number of times, the second solution used a mathematical operator to return the result in one line. So which one is the better approach, of course the second one.


## What is Time Complexity

Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the totasl time required by the program to run till its completion.

The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the **big O notation**.
It's an aymptotic notation to represent the time complexity.

Time Complexity is most commonly esitmated by counting the number of elementary steps performed by any algoithm to finish its execution. Like in the example above, for the first code the loop will run n number of times, so the time complexity will be n at least and as the value of n will increase the time taken will also increase. While for the second code, time complexity is constant, because it will never be dependant on the value of n, it will always give the result in 1 step.

And since the algorithm's performance may vary with different types of input data, hence for an algorithm we usually use the **worst-case Time Complexity** of an algorithm because that is the maximum time taken for any input size.
