# Notes

JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the 
data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;

creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made 
up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
