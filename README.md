## Intro to Data Structure and Algorithms

Data structure is a way of organising data in such a way that we can perform operatioons on these data in an effective way. Data structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have some adat which has, player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is a **String** data type and 26 is of **Integer** data type.

We can organize this data as a record like **Player** record, which will have both player's name and age in it. Now we can collect and store player's records in a file or database as a data structure. **For example**: "Dhoni" 30, "Gambhi" 31, "Sue" 35.

If you are aware of OO programming concepts, then a **class** also does the same thing, it collects differect types of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides for techniaues to access and manipulate data efficiently. 

In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various oprations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized by memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces complexity and increases efficiency.

## Basic Types of Data Structures

Anything that can store data can be called a data structure, hence Integer, Float, Boolean, Char ect, all are data structures. They are known as **Primitive Data Structures**.

Then we also have some complex Data Structres, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of **Abstract Data Structures** are:
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Stack, Queue ect.

All these data structures allow us to perform different operations on data. We select these data structures based on which type of operation is required.

### Intro to Data Structures

Data structures can be classified on the basis of the following characteristics:

| Characteristic  | Description |
| :---            | :----:      |
| Linear          | 	In Linear data structures,the data items are arranged in a linear sequence. Example: Array |
